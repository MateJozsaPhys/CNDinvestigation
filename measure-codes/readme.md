## Here you can find algorithms for graph measures implemented in the article.

### Structure of *measure-codes*:
* **expl_metabolic.bin** contains the edge-list of a metabolic network in binary format for example
* **measures-implemented.ipynb** contains codes of the measures implemented by the authors, along with examples of their usage on a metabolic network
* **measures-builtin.ipynb** contains codes of the built-in measures in NetworkX and igraph, along with examples of their usage on a metabolic network
